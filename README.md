# Digit-Analysis
Handwritten digit analysis is a fundamental task in computer vision and machine learning, with applications in areas such as optical character recognition (OCR), automated form processing, and digitization of historical documents. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in this task, achieving near-human accuracy on benchmark datasets like MNIST.

In this project, two separate models are prepared, each using PyTorch and Tensorflow/Keras respectively, to build and train CNN model on the MNIST dataset. I have experimented with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to develop models with high accuracy and generalization ability.
